                                     <h3>What is Mutual Fund?</h3>
                                     <p>A mutual fund is an investment vehicle where many investors pool their money to earn returns on their capital over a period. This corpus of funds is managed by an investment professional known as a fund manager or portfolio manager. It is his/her job to invest the corpus in different securities such as bonds, stocks, gold and other assets and seek to provide potential returns. The gains (or losses) on the investment are shared collectively by the investors in proportion to their contribution to the fund.</p>

                                                 <p>Prospective investors can think that SIPs and mutual funds are the same. However,
SIPs are merely a method of investing in mutual funds, the other method being a
lump sum. A SIP calculator is a tool that helps you determine the returns you can avail
when parking your funds in such investment tools. Systematic Investment Plan or SIP
is a process of investing a fixed sum of money in mutual funds at regular intervals.
SIPs usually allow you to invest weekly, quarterly, or monthly.</p>

But before you invest, take an adequate amount of time to go through the different fund options. Don’t invest in a fund because your colleague or friend has invested in it. Identify your goals and invest accordingly. If required, you can approach a financial advisor to help you make the right investment decisions and plan your financial journey.</p>

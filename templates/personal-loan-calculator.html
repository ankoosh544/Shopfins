                                                 <p>At Bajaj Finserv, the personal loan age limit is between 23 and 55 years. Hence, the maximum age to avail a loan is 55 years. But, the younger an applicant is, the better is his/her chance to get the loan approval at a lower rate of interest. It is because he/she has more working years left than an applicant in his/her 50s. Thus, the applicant won’t face issues in paying the loan EMIs without the risks of defaulting.

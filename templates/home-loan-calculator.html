Benefits</h3>
                                     <p>The key benefit of a home loan is that you can become a homeowner today and you needn’t wait to accumulate sufficient capital to make your home purchase. Additionally, your home loan repayment tenure can extend up to 30 years depending on your loan eligibility and other norms of the home loan provider (the longer your loan tenure, lower is the EMI amount). This gives you the comfort of repayment over a long period without putting pressure on your finances.</p>
                                     <p>The home loan can not only be taken for the purchase of the property but also the construction or renovation of the house.</p>

Lenders have their own base rate which determines the rate of interest charged on a home loan. The base rates of banks are revised from time to time based on RBI directives as well as other factors, which leads to an increase or decrease in the EMI amount payable.

This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting interest rates. For instance, if the RBI increases interest rates on loans, then people with fixed rate home loans will not be affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of home loan is less popular these days.

In case of a floating rate home loan, the banks are now required to change the interest rate either yearly or every six months. In case you have a fixed rate home loan, you can get in touch with your bank to get information regarding the conversion of your fixed rate home loan to the new MCLR-based floating interest rate. At present, the introduction of the new MCLR regime has led to a reduction in applicable home loan interest rates.

The interest rates on a top up loan are less than a personal loan and it requires little or no paperwork to process this loan and the money can be used for a range of expenses.

                                                 <p>Yes. You can have a family member like your spouse or your parents co-sign with you when you apply for a home loan. Having a cosigner for your home loan improves your chances of being approved for a larger home loan amount.  A co-signer is especially recommended if the primary applicant has a low credit score or has had problems when applying/paying off a loan in the past.

                                                 <p>A home loan is a long term loan (5 to 30 years tenure), hence lenders want to ensure that they will get their money back in the long term. Therefore, the loan sanctioning authority will definitely check your credit history before sanctioning a home loan to you. By having a good credit record/history you would be classified as a low-risk borrower and you may be able to get preferred (low) interest rates and waivers on various bank fees on the basis of your credit history.

However, you can improve your chances by getting a co-borrower. The co-borrower needs to be a family member like your spouse or parents. Ideally, you should choose a co-borrower who has a regular source of income and good credit history to better your chances of a successful application.

In such a situation, the bank is liable to charge a pre-EMI interest on your loan. This interest is payable monthly from the time the loan is disbursed till the time the EMI payments start off. The pre-EMI interest amount is lower than the home loan EMI as the principal payment portion is excluded for pre-EMI interest payments.

On average, lenders implement a 20% margin on home loans i.e. the home loan amount sanctioned to you will be 80% of the actual cost of the property. The remaining 20% of the home loan cost will have to be borne by you. Though the 20% margin is the industry average, lenders may increase or decrease their home loan margins on a case by case basis.

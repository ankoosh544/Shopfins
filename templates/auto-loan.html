Most banks offer financing up to 90% of the on-road price of the car but there are some banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, etc., that offer financing for up to 100% of the car’s on-road price.

                                                 <p>Yes, you can prepay the entire car loan and save on vital interest payments in the future. However, most banks will allow the prepayment option after you have chalked off 6 months on your loan tenure. Plus, you will be expected to pay a small fee as a prepayment penalty that will be dependent on the leftover loan amount.

The other factors that lenders look for when you apply for a car loan are your employment status, residence and job stability, income, debt-to-income ratio, etc.

For example, let us suppose that you avail a car loan of Rs.1 lakh at an interest rate of 12% for a tenure of 5 years. Using the tool, we calculated the EMI and found it to be Rs.2,224.

When you avail a lower loan amount, there are chances that banks or lenders may offer you a car loan at lower interest rates. This is simply because if the loan amount is lower, the repayment will be quicker. So, though there is no hard and fast rule to how much down payment you should make, a higher down payment will ensure that your debt liability is lesser.

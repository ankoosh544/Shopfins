                                             <div class="faq-content">
                                                 <p>At Bajaj Finserv, the personal loan age limit is between 23 and 55 years. Hence, the maximum age to avail a loan is 55 years. But, the younger an applicant is, the better is his/her chance to get the loan approval at a lower rate of interest. It is because he/she has more working years left than an applicant in his/her 50s. Thus, the applicant won’t face issues in paying the loan EMIs without the risks of defaulting.

                                                 <p>Although the required CIBIL score for personal loan is 750+, you can also get the loan approval when you have a lower credit score. You won’t get the loan approval if the CIBIL score is under 599. However, if you have a score of 600-700, you may get the loan approval, but at a higher rate of interest. It may affect your budget and lead to an increased EMI amount.

                                                 <p>Yes, a person can have a personal loan and a home loan account at the same time. If you have an ongoing personal loan and you are seeking a home loan, then you can apply for it. The only condition is that your debt to income ratio should not be above 50%. You can have multiple personal loans and yet apply for a home loan. You should ensure having higher creditworthiness so that you can manage home loan and personal loan repayments.
